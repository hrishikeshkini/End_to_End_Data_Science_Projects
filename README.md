Hi, my name is Hrishikesh Kini.



<p>I am Hrishikesh Kini, aspiring data scientist who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in engineering, statistics, and machine learning.</p>


# Get to Know Me 

### My Portfolio Website

<p align="center">
<a href="https://hrishikeshkini.github.io/portfolio/"><img src="images/Capture.PNG"></a></p>
  
  <p> I built the site in Hugo using pieces of an existing design on <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. Though I am not interested in Front-End Development, I created and deployed this website on a <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> server so that I could learn more about web app design and back-end development. Though I did learn a lot from making this website, much of the joy that came from this project was found making something of my own and putting it out into the world.</p>

# My Past Projects

<hr>

### [RNNs, LSTMs, and Attention Mechanisms for Language Modelling (PyTorch)](https://github.com/harrisonjansma/2019_Notes/tree/master/ML/NLP/PyTorch%20RNN%20Implementations)


<p>
Tested the use of Word2Vec embeddings with a variety of sequential input deep learning models towards the task of language modeling (predicting the next word in a sentence).

### [DavisBase: A Custom Designed SQL Database](https://github.com/harrisonjansma/DavisBase)

<p>
A fully functional, SQL-compliant database implemented from scratch in Python. DavisBase compresses data to a custom-designed bit-level encoding for maximal data compression. By utilizing a file size of 512Kb, DavisBase performs well in low memory environments while also maximizing query time.

### [Reinforcement Learning: Dynamic Policy Gradients (Numpy)](https://github.com/harrisonjansma/2019_Notes/blob/master/RL/2_Policy-Iteration-QLearning/Dynamic_Programming_Policy_Iteration.ipynb)


<p>
My implementation of dynamic policy gradients in Python. This reinforcement learning algorithm was then used to train an agent to traverse a dangerous environment.

### [Hidden Markov Models for Parts of Speech Tagging (Python)](https://github.com/harrisonjansma/2019_Notes/blob/master/ML/Hidden%20Markov%20Model%20Implementation/HW2%20Sandbox.ipynb)


<p>
Custom implementation of Hidden Markov Models to assign parts of speech labels to a free text dataset. Model was coded from scratch in base Python and utilizes the Viterbi Algorithm for decoding the probability of a given sequence.

### [Named Entity Recognition with Scikit-Learn and PyTorch](https://github.com/harrisonjansma/2019_Notes/tree/master/ML/NLP/NER%20Analysis)

<p>
Applied deep neural networks to the task of finding named entities (like "Google", or "Harrison") within the CoNLL (2003) dataset. A logistic regression and LSTM were trained on the data and achieved F1 scores of 0.926 and 0.899 respectively.
 </p>

### [XGBoost for Text Classification](https://github.com/harrisonjansma/2019_Notes/blob/master/ML/Gradient%20Boosting%20Notes/Gradient%20Boosting%20Theory.ipynb)

<p>
Utilized Python's XGBoost package to implement gradient boosting on a textual dataset. A similar code was later used during my work at Sprint to build machine learning models for text classification.
 </p>

### [PySpark and HIVE for Data Analysis](https://github.com/harrisonjansma/2019_Notes/blob/master/Data%20Engineering/Big%20Data/PySpark-1.ipynb)

<p>
Worked on an AWS EMR cluster to learn the basics of PySpark and HIVE while working at Sprint. These tools allowed me to collect massive amounts of data from Sprint's production data lake.

### [Implementing Common Algorithms in C++](https://github.com/harrisonjansma/Cpp-Algorithm-Implementations)

<p>
The only way to become a not-garbage-coder is to code a lot. This repository contains some of the coursework I've completed over the last few months. As the semester winds down, I hope to start a new passion project soon!
